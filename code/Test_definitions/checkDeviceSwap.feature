    Background: Common checkDeviceSwap setup
        Given the resource "device-swap/v1rc1/check"
        And the header "Content-Type" is set to "application/json"
        And the header "Authorization" is set to a valid access token
        And the header "x-correlator" complies with the schema at "#/components/schemas/XCorrelator"
        And the request body is set by default to a request body compliant with the schema

    # This first scenario serves as a minimum, not testing any specific verificationResult
    @check_device_swap_1_generic_success_scenario
    Scenario: Common validations for any sucess scenario
        Given a valid phone number identified by the token or provided in the request body
        When the request "checkDeviceSwap" is sent
        Then the response status code is 200
        And the response header "Content-Type" is "application/json"
        And the response header "x-correlator" has same value as the request header "x-correlator"
        And the response body complies with the OAS schema at "/components/schemas/CheckDeviceSwapInfo"

        And the device has been swapped in the last 240 hours
        When the request "checkDeviceSwap" is sent
        Then the response status code is 200
